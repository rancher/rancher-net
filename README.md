========

This repository is used for packaging all the networking related
binaries into a single image.

You can find the actual code here:
- IPSec: https://github.com/rancher/ipsec
- VXLAN: https://github.com/rancher/vxlan
- Per Host Subnet: https://github.com/rancher/per-host-subnet
- Rancher CNI Bridge Plugin: https://github.com/rancher/rancher-cni-bridge
- Rancher CNI IPAM Plugin: https://github.com/rancher/rancher-cni-ipam
- Rancher Host Local IPAM Plugin: https://github.com/rancher/rancher-host-local-ipam
- CNI Driver: https://github.com/rancher/cni-driver

## Building

`make`

If you would like to build using a custom repo and tag:

`REPO=your_docker_repo TAG=dev_or_sth_else make release`

The individual binaries can be customized during the build using the following:

Repos:

- RANCHER_IPSEC_REPO
- RANCHER_VXLAN_REPO
- RANCHER_CNI_BRIDGE_REPO
- RANCHER_CNI_IPAM_REPO
- RANCHER_CNI_DRIVER_REPO
- RANCHER_PER_HOST_SUBNET_REPO
- RANCHER_HOST_LOCAL_IPAM_REPO

Tags:

- RANCHER_IPSEC_TAG
- RANCHER_VXLAN_TAG
- RANCHER_CNI_BRIDGE_TAG
- RANCHER_CNI_IPAM_TAG
- RANCHER_CNI_DRIVER_TAG
- RANCHER_PER_HOST_SUBNET_TAG
- RANCHER_HOST_LOCAL_IPAM_TAG


For example:

```
REPO=leodotcloud TAG=test RANCHER_IPSEC_REPO=leodotcloud RANCHER_IPSEC_TAG=dev make
```

This would pick up the ipsec binaries from the private `dev` release and package them in the docker image `leodotcloud/net:test`.
